THIS IS THE OLD JAVA CODE

CHANGE TO C++


 * This file will handle the speed of the motor
 * controller. Will need functions such as speed()
 * emergencyStop(), direction(). Will receive input
 * signals from Onboard_Master_CCP
 

public class Motor_Controller {

    public Motor_Controller() {

    }

    
     * Used to determine if whole carriage is
     * operational
     
    boolean operational() {
